# BTC Algorithmic Trading Bot App (DEMO)


#### *This repository serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of an algorithmic trading bot I built. Please note that this is not a fully functional trading bot application but rather a simulated version showing the capabilities of an actual trading bot.*

## Quick Notes

- *This repository is a reconstructed version of an actual trading bot app.*
- *The demo simulates real trades based on BTC price action.*
- *The strategy demonstrated in this app is not intended for direct replication.*
- *Certain features of the app have been disabled for the demo.*
- *Do not copy trading logic, you will lose money. This is for the demo only*

  

## **Trading Strategy**

*The demo app is replicating real trades based on real BTC price action. It's using a strategy which is for demo purposes only. For the sake of the demostration, it doesn't take into consideration trading fees and slippage which means it isn't profitable.*
